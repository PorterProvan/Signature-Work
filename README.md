UST has instilled in every undergraduate that the valuable skills we acquire during our four years can be used to advance the common good. Through my computer science coursework, I believe that Dr. Yilek’s information security classes have truly fulfilled this goal. In these classes, we explore famous attacks on cryptographic tools and vulnerabilities in poorly written code. Two of my favorite attacks that we studied and implemented were the buffer overflow attack and the padding oracle attack.

A padding oracle lets an attacker uncover the original message from an encrypted block. Since the cipher block and IV are sent openly, an attacker can intercept them. The attacker can then change the IV and send it to a "padding oracle" that freely responds to queries about whether a message is correctly padded or not. By carefully changing each byte of the IV and doing xor calculations, the attacker can figure out the original message byte by byte until the entire cipher block is decrypted. Repeating this process over all cipher blocks lets the attacker uncover the whole message.

To protect against padding oracle attacks, modern networks use authenticated encryption methods, such as AES-GCM or AES-CCM. These approaches ensure that the ciphertext is both encrypted and verified for integrity before decryption. This makes the padding oracle attack impossible because any change to the IV or ciphertext is immediately detected and rejected. Additionally, secure systems eliminate detailed error messages or timing differences that could give away clues to an attacker.

Learning about the padding oracle attack and its fixes taught me the importance of designing systems that prioritize security. This is vital for protecting sensitive data, whether it’s an individual’s personal information or a company’s financial records. By addressing vulnerabilities like the padding oracle attack, we prevent potential harm and foster trust in the technologies that are integral to society. This focus on securing systems directly aligns with the mission of UST. By learning how to identify and address security flaws, I feel prepared to contribute to the common good by protecting people’s privacy and ensuring the safety and integrity of their data.

The buffer overflow attack is the most important attack I’ve learned about, particularly due to its wider implication on memory management and the vulnerabilities it exposes in low-level programming languages and embedded systems. A buffer overflow occurs when a user writes more data into a buffer than it is allotted, causing the overflow that overwrites adjacent memory on the stack. This can lead to the injection of malicious code, the alteration of critical values, or the redirection of execution to unauthorized code. In class, we experimented with a C program vulnerable to buffer overflow that, when exploited, returned to shellcode instructions that granted malicious root access to the system.

In class, we learned how to identify when buffer overflow attacks can occur and how to rewrite code to prevent them. For example, the C function `strcpy()` is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack because it does not check the size of the destination buffer before copying data into it. We learned that a simple fix is to use the C function `strncpy()` instead, as it allows you to specify a maximum number of bytes to copy, ensuring that the buffer limit is not exceeded.

I also learned about stack canaries, ASLR, and non-executable stack, which are additional buffer overflow defenses that can be applied to any language. Stack canaries involve placing special values in memory to detect buffer overflows before they cause harm. ASLR randomizes memory addresses, making it more difficult for attackers to predict where their malicious code will be placed. Non-executable stack protection prevents code from being executed in areas of memory that should only store data, such as the stack, which helps stop injected shellcode from running. These techniques, when combined with safer coding practices, provide great protection against buffer overflow attacks.

Learning about buffer overflow attacks taught me how critical memory management is and how dangerous it can be if not properly protected. There are hundreds of potential attacks that can arise from allowing users to write to unpermitted memory, with many large companies citing memory mismanagement—like buffer overflow attacks—as a primary cause of their vulnerabilities. This connects directly with UST's commitment to the common good. By understanding buffer overflow attacks and how to prevent them, I am equipped to identify vulnerabilities in essential software systems. For example, imagine hospital software that is crucial to the functioning of a hospital. A malicious user could exploit a buffer overflow to gain root access and shut down the system. By being able to identify such vulnerabilities, I can help ensure the safety and security of vital systems and, in doing so, contribute to the common good.

In conclusion, the lessons learned in Dr. Yilek’s information security classes have provided me with lifelong skills that are crucial for protecting sensitive data and systems. These skills align with UST's mission to promote the common good by preparing students to address security challenges and protect vital technologies. With this knowledge, I am ready to ensure privacy, safety, and the integrity of systems throughout my professional career.
